_________

The new and improved version of my [original](https://bcheung98.github.io/genshin-impact-reference-sheet/) *Genshin Impact* character reference website. 

The website lists all playable characters from *Genshin Impact*, their element, weapon, rarity, and the materials need to level up each character. In addition, the website now contains information about a character's talents and constellation, along with some miscellaneous data, in a dialog popup that can be accessed by pressing the "More Info" button for the respective character. The website also has a cleaner look thanks to Material UI.
